<h1>SDL_WindowEventID</h1>
<p>An enumeration of window events.
<h2>Values</h2>
<table>
<tr style="color: #808080;"><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_NONE</td><td>(never used)</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SHOWN</td><td>window has been shown</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_HIDDEN</td><td>window has been hidden</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED</td><td>window has been exposed and should be redrawn</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MOVED</td><td>window has been moved to data1, data2</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED</td><td>window has been resized to data1xdata2; this is event is always preceded by SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_SIZE_CHANGED</td><td>window size has changed, either as a result of an API call or through the system or user changing the window size; this event is followed by SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESIZED if the size was changed by an external event, i.e. the user or the window manager</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MINIMIZED</td><td>window has been minimized</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MAXIMIZED</td><td>window has been maximized</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_RESTORED</td><td>window has been restored to normal size and position</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_ENTER</td><td>window has gained mouse focus</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_LEAVE</td><td>window has lost mouse focus</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_FOCUS_GAINED</td><td>window has gained keyboard focus</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_FOCUS_LOST</td><td>window has lost keyboard focus</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE</td><td>the window manager requests that the window be closed</td></tr>
