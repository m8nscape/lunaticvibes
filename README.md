# Lunatic Vibes

Lunatic Vibes is a rhythm game that plays community-made charts in BMS format.

The project is basically a rewritten version of the Lunatic Rave 2 (beta3 100201). 

The project is still in development stage. Please do not expect a bug-free experience. Feel free to open issues.


## Features

* Multi-threaded update procedure
* Async input handling
* Full Unicode support
* Built-in difficulty table support
* Mixed skin resolution support (SD, HD, FHD)
* ARENA Mode over LAN / VLAN

## Requirements
  * **Do NOT use this application to load unauthorized copyrighted contents (e.g. charts, skins).**
  * Supported OS: Windows 7+


## Quick Start

* Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015+ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
* Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/yaasdf/lunaticvibes/releases)
* Copy LR2files folder from LR2 (must include default theme; a fresh copy right from LR2 release is recommended)


## Build

### Windows (CMake + Visual Studio 2022)

1. Clone repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yaasdf/lunaticvibes.git
    cd lunaticvibes
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. Configure / Build FFmpeg (Optional)

    The configured header files are included now (see [#1](https://github.com/yaasdf/lunaticvibes/issues/1)), though it's recommended to configure FFmpeg yourself.

    If you are going to configure FFmpeg, check out `ext/FFmpeg/build_lib.md` for instructions. Default configuration emits chunkload around 100MB


3. Install dependencies via vcpkg (skip any you have already installed)
    ```
    vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
    vcpkg install boost:x64-windows
    vcpkg install curl:x64-windows
    vcpkg install luajit:x64-windows
    ```

4. Choose a generator to build

    a. VS2022 (via console)

        ```
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
        cmake --build . --config Release -j -t LunaticVibes
        ```

    b. Ninja (via IDE)

        - Open project folder with Visual Studio
        - Open CMake configuration, fill CMake toolchain file to the one from vcpkg like "D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
        - Build LunaticVibes.exe
